Theano
-------
Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano features:

    tight integration with NumPy – Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions.
    transparent use of a GPU – Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)
    efficient symbolic differentiation – Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.
    speed and stability optimizations – Get the right answer for log(1+x) even when x is really tiny.
    dynamic C code generation – Evaluate expressions faster.
    extensive unit-testing and self-verification – Detect and diagnose many types of mistake.

Theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific investigations since 2007. But it is also approachable enough to be used in the classroom (IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).
